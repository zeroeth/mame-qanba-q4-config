mame-qanba-q4-config
====================

Storing up mame settings for qanba sticks (and eventually others) in 360 and ps3 mode.

Every time I come to a new computer its the same routine, player 1, button 1.. 2.. 3.. 4.. 5.. 6.. start.. coin.

This config will add player 1 qanba q4 bindings while retaining the original keyboard and mouse setup.
